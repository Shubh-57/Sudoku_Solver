# Sudoku_Solver

Description :
This repository contains a C++ program that solves Sudoku puzzles. The program utilizes backtracking and constraint propagation techniques to find the solution for any valid Sudoku grid.

Features :
1. Sudoku Solver Algorithm: The program employs a backtracking algorithm to systematically explore possible solutions and find the correct solution for a given Sudoku puzzle.

2. Input Flexibility: The solver accepts Sudoku puzzles as input in the form of a 9x9 grid. You can input puzzles directly in the code.

3. Performance Optimization: The solver utilizes constraint propagation techniques, to reduce the search space and improve solving efficiency.

4. Error Handling: The program includes robust error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and ensure smooth execution.
